# MTF_data_set
the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations.

## Data distribution
The MTF data set contains a distinct distribution of celebrities' image faces that emerged across different labels. While our initial efforts aimed to crawl a balanced number of images across all tasks and labels, the real distribution of the data available online led to an imbalance within the data set. This imbalance can be attributed to various factors. I) Celebrities from different regions of the world publish their images at varying rates and under different copyright licenses. II) Young celebrities tend to publish their images more frequently than elderly celebrities. III) Elderly celebrities often have more images from their younger days than images from their current age.

| Task  | Label | Celebrities | Image |
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
|Face recognition| Celebrities names| 240| 5246|
|Race classification| Asian (Chinese/Korean)| 80|1715|
| | Asian (Indian)| 49|820|
| | Black | 35| 478|
| | White | 76| 2133|
